#Pros
 - In my opinion, it's easier for newcommer to understand EDIT: Not that much after using useMemo/useCallback

#Cons
 - If you want to keep the container paradigm, you need to pass props by yourself
 - You don't benefit from handlers optimisation and break pure components easily EDIT: This point is not a pb using useMemo/useCallback
 - It just look like a bunch of optimisation... It make it hard to read the real code in there
